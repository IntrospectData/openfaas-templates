# OpenFaaS Templates


## Fair Warning - Not really serverless...

**Fair Warning** - some of these templates aren't really 'serverless'.  We know. Based on the way that the [new watchdog](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/of-watchdog) process is shaping up, there are some cool ways to leverage the structure of OpenFaaS to build basic APIs in simple structures. That's not the only template here, but before anyone decides to 'correct' us on this, we actually think it's a huge advantage of OpenFaaS over other tools - namely that we can leverage one toolset to serve multiple modalities of code and (we think) do so pretty darn efficiently.
